1. To our dear and Christian Friends in and near to Beverly, who are of doubtful mind in this hour of Temptation, enquiring after the way of God more perfectly, which ſome ſay is found among the Separated people, called Quakers, Truth and Peace be multiplyed.

    _ But we ſhall proceed to enquire into that doctrine which ſaith, The light in you (which alſo enlighteneth every man that commeth into the world) is Chriſt.

    _ Further they ſay, This light (before mentioned) is Pure.

    _ Moreover they affirm, that This light diſcovers every evill as it ariſeth in the heart.

    _ Yet further they boldly conclude, that Power accompanies that light to destroy every evill as it appears in them that yield up themſelves to it, and watch that their vain minds draw them not from abiding in the pure light of Chriſt, Thus, they ſay, is help layed on one mighty to ſave, even Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Author of eternall ſalvation to all them that obey him.

    _ But that we may take the foxes, and the little foxes that ſpoil our vines which began to have tender grapes let's yet make ſearch and ſee how for the driving on the great deſign of overthrowing the Goſpel as adminiſtred by Man, and weakning the Authority of the holy Scriptures, they ſeek to perſwade all Men, that that light in them is the Goſpel, and the ſure Word of Prophecy, to which they would do well to take heed, until the day dawn, and the day-ſtar ariſe in their hearts.

    _ Moreover they affirm, That this Light (the ſame which they ſay is in every one that cometh into the world) is the anointing from the Father, that they need not teach one another.

    _ To the evidencing of which in part, be pleaſed to hear them uſing the word of the Scriptures, ſaying, The Kingdome of God is within you,Luk. 17. 21.(and this they ſay of and to all the children of this world)

    _ But it ſufficeth not to our Adverſaries to have left things in General, but they alſo affirm that Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptiſts and ſuch differing forms, are all in the Kingdom of Babylon and in the confuſions of it.

    _ Some indeed ſay that Paſtors, Teachers, Elders, Churches and ſuch adminiſtrations ended with the Apoſtles age, and that it is not for us to ſeek them, but a more ſpiritual way.

    _ It is not a Pleaſure to us (Beloved in the Lord) to open theſe painted Sepulcres, but ſince we have begun we will proceed to ſhew yet more, that you may ſee and wonder, and beware. They bid you Speak no more than you have experience of, and than you live in.

    _ Moreover they admoniſh that we wait in ſilence untill God open our Mouthes.

    _ Furthermore theſe who come unto you in the imitation and reſemblance of Chriſt, Prophets, Mat. 24. 24.Apoſtles, with their deemed Oracles and great wonders, do ſhew themſelves in the moſt compoſed garb of humility, as the greateſt friends to the croſſe of Chriſt, and the onely bearers of it, diſſwading you From your own wiſdome, will, righteouſneſſe, Pride in apparell, Diet, &c. giving and receiving honour of men, and ſuch like, which is the croſſe you muſt abide in, and through it (they ſay) paſſe unto everlaſting reſt.

    _ Furthermore, we think it convenient in this place to adde ſomething touching Propriety and Community in worldly things, becauſe we have ſufficient reaſon to perſwade us to judge that the Maintainers of the fore-mentioned Doctrines which are oppoſed by us, do think it unreaſonable that one man ſhould have ſo much, and another ſo little, and ſome of them are not free to be Tenants to other men.

    _ Finally, they ſay That God is now come to redeem his people from all outward Teachers, and teach them himſelf, and for proof this Prophecy they bring 1 John 2. 26. Jer. 31. 31. Iſa. 54. 13. Joh. 6. 45. Heb. 8. 11. Ezek. 34. 11, 12. Jer. 23. 23.

    _ We ſhall conclude, pointing you to ſome ſerious thoughts concerning the Doctrines and practiſes of theſe people, which God may order for good ends;
